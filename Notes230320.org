The first step to approaching rhythm is this way: You go to the root. The root is mathematics. And you find the representation in Music, that is the second step. Third step, you find out a method to [unclear...] give this as a presentation. That is the third steps.
[...]
When you are not getting a presentation, you go back to mathematics.

It is a cycle.

When you are not getting a pattern, go to mathematics.
